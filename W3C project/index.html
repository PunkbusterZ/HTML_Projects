    <p>from 1945 to 1995</p>
    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>
      Vannevar Bush writes an article in Atlantic Monthly about a
      photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension,
      which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche
    </p>
    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>
      Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext
      browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose.
      See the Bootstrap Institute library.

      Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex,
      the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York,
      Association for Computing Machinery, 1965. See also: Literary Machines.
      Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A
      Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the
      resource did not maintain the link.

    <p>
      Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in
      1967.
    </p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>
      While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a
      notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to
      be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list
      of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under
      SINTRAN-III. See: Enquire user manual as scanned images or as HTML
      page(alt).

        <a href="">"Information Management: A Proposal"</a> written by Tim BL
        and circulated for comments at CERN (TBL). Paper "HyperText and CERN"
        produced as background (text or WriteNow format).

        Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows
        Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.

      <dd>
        Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep
        development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the
        program. (See the first browser screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name
        for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and
        Information Mine). Project original proposal reformulated with
        encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert Cailliau
        (ECP) joins and is co-author of new version.
      </dd>
      <dt>November</dt>
      <dd>
        Initial WorldWideWeb program development continues on the NeXT (TBL) .
        This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with
        direct inline creation of links. The first web server was
        nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the first web page
        http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN
        no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the
        least recently modified web page we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov
        1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)

        Technical Student Nicola Pellow (CN) joins and starts work on the
        line-mode browser. Bernd Pollermann (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM
        "FIND" index running. TBL gives a colloquium on hypertext in general.
      </dd>
      <dt>Christmas</dt>
      <dd>
        Line mode browser and WorldWideWeb browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is
        possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.
